We are CWRUbotix, Case Western Reserve Universityâ€™s robotics club. We like long walks on the beach (with robots), designing and building robots for a variety of robotics competitions, and engaging with the local STEM community. Our primary goal is to provide a learning environment for students interested in robotics, regardless of prior experience. We focus on teaching our members technical skills such as CAD modeling, circuit design, programming, and manufacturing. Currently we attend the MATE ROV competition and an assortment of National Robotics Challenges.

The National Robotics Challenge (NRC) is a collection of robotics competitions rolled into one large event. Held nearby in Marion, Ohio in the beginning of April, the competitions are open to students from 6th grade through graduate school. Competitions range from combat robots to pick and place machines to hockey playing robots. In 2022, our teams participated in the Combat, and Micromouse competitions.
